1. The standard deviation of 100 W light bulbs whose life span follows a normal distribution
is given to be 120 hours and a half-life of same is guaranteed to be 700 hours of under
warranty. 100 bulbs are selected at random from the lot whose half-life is determined to be
650 hours. If the signicance level is 0.01, then the lot should be rejected or not for not
restricting to the guarantee?

SD= 120 hrs 
Half-Life Mean= 700 hrs under warranty 
n=100 bulbs at random 
Half- Life Determined Popoulation Mean- 650 Hrs 
Significance Level - 0.01 - 0.95 
H0= Half life of the bulbs is >=700 hrs  
H1= half life of the bulbs is <=700 hrs

Df= 1-n= 24
Alpha Level = (1-.95)/2 = 0.25
Z score = 1 - 0.25=0.975=1.96 = 2.33
Using formula for t-test statistics = mean – sample mean/std dev/root of n =700-2.33/120/root of 100 = 650
H0 - Cannot be accepted with a significance level of 1%.

3.Using 25 observations and 5 regressor, including the constant term, a
researcher estimates a
linear regression model by OLS and finds
b2 = 4.21 ,st.err. of b2 = 1.80
b3 = −0.116 ,st.err. of b3 = 0.0388
Let t20df be a random variable having a t distribution with n − K = 25 −
5 = 20 d.f.. Use the
following probabilities:
Prob(t20df > 1.75) = .05
Prob(t20df > 2.086) = .025
For each of the pairs of hypotheses given below, use a t-test to
accept or reject H0 at the 5%
significance level. Show your reasoning.
(a) H0 : β2 = 0 ; Ha : β2 < 0
(b) H0 : β2 = 0 ; Ha : β2 6= 0
(c) H0 : β2 = 0 ; Ha : β2 > 0
(d) H0 : β3 = 0 ; Ha : β3 < 0
(e) H0 : β3 = 0 ; Ha : β3 6= 0
(f) H0 : β3 = 0 ; Ha : β3 > 0
(g) H0 : β2 = 1 ; Ha : β2 6= 1


(a) t = (4.21 - 0)/1.80 = 2.34 Reject if t < −1.725. Since t > −1.725, then accept H0 at the 5% significance level
(b) t = 2.34 Reject if |t| > 2.086. Since t = 2.34, then |t| > 2.086, so reject H0 at the 5% level 
(c) t = 2.34 Reject if t > 1.725. Since t > 1.725, then reject H0 at the 5% level 5
(d) t = (−0.116 − 0)/.0388 = −2.99 Reject if t < −1.725. Since t < −1.725, then reject H0 at the 5% level 
(e) t = -2.99 Reject if |t| > 2.086. Since t = −2.99, then |t| > 2.086, so reject H0 at 5% level
(f) t = -2.99 Reject if t > 1.725. Therefore accept H0 at the 5% level 
(g) t = (4.21 − 1)/1.80 = 1.78 Reject if |t| > 2.086. Since t = 1.78, then |t| < 2.086, so accept H0 at the 5% level 




4.The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences states
that the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of iron for adult females
under the age of 51 is 18 milligrams (mg). A sample of iron intake in was
obtained during a 24-hour period from 45 randomly selected adult
females under the age of 51. It revealed that the sample mean () was
14.68 mg. At the 1 percent significance level, does the data suggest that
adult females under the age of 51 are, on average, getting less than the
RDA of 18 mg of iron? Assume that the population standard deviation is
4.2 mg.
`
N=45  
mean=14.68 
std dev= 4.2   
type of test – left tailed test
Stating the hypothesis – H0 – Mean = 18 mg 
Ha – Mean <=18 mg 

Degree to significance – in percentage alpha =1%
level of signifiance, alpha = 0.01

Computing the value of test statistics(Z)
Mean/x – mean = 18
std dev = std/root of n = 4.2/root 45 
z=mean – sample mean/std dev/root of n =(14.68-18) /4.2 root of 45 = -5.30
Type of test – Left tailed – critical value – Za=-2.33
Compare the values of test statistics,Z and critical value Za or +Za/2
Interpret the results of the hypothesis 
at 1 % significance level, the data provides sufficient evidence to conclude that adult females under the age of 51% are on average, getting less then the RDA of 18mg of iron. 


P-Value Approach 

Determine the P- value 
p-value=P(z<=Z)=P(z<=-5.3)= 0.0000 small 
Rejet H0 since 0.0000<0.01

5.Boys of a certain age are known to have a mean weight of μ = 85 pounds. A
complaint is made that the boys living in a municipal children's home are
underfed. As one bit of evidence, n = 25 boys (of the same age) are
weighed and found to have a mean weight of x¯ = 80.94 pounds. It is
known that the population standard deviation σ is 11.6 pounds (the
unrealistic part of this example!).  Based on the available data, what
should be concluded concerning the complaint?

μ = 85 pounds
n=25 
mean = 80.94
sd=11.6

H0:u= 85
H1:u<85
z=80.94-85/11.63/root of 25 = -1.75
Alpha=0.05,

So, Z=<=-1.645 so, we reject the null hypothesis.

P - Value approach 

P-value ≤ α = 0.05. In this case, the P-value is P(Z < −1.75) = 0.040
So, we reject the null hypothesis


6.It is assumed that the mean systolic blood pressure is μ = 120 mm Hg. In the
Honolulu Heart Study, a sample of n = 100 people had an average
systolic blood pressure of 130.1 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 21.21
mm Hg. Is the group significantly different (with respect to systolic blood
pressure!) from the regular population?

u= 120 mm Hg
N=100 
Avg Systolic Blood pressure Mean = 130.1 mm 
SD=21.21

H0:u=120
H1:u not equal 120

t=130.1-120/21.21/root of 100 = 4.76

Reject the Null Hypothesis

P-value approach tells us to reject the null hypothesis at the α = 0.05 level if the P-value ≤ α = 0.05. 
P-value is 2 × P(T99 >4.762) < 2 × P(T99 >1.9842) = 2(0.025) = 0.05:



7.Salary Wizard is an online tool that allows you to look up incomes for specific
jobs for cities in the United State. We looked up the 25th percentile for
income for six jobs in two cities: Boise, Idaho, and Los Angeles, California.
The data are below.
Jobs 					Boise Los Angeles
Executive chef 				53047       62490
Genetics counselor			49958       58850
Grants/proposal writer               	41974       49445

Public schoolteacher 			40470       47674
Social worker (with bachelor's degree) 	36963       43542

How can we conduct a paired-samples t test to determine whether
income in one of these cities differs, on average, from income in the
other?
Calculate am independent t-test

Population 1 - job types boise,idaho
Population 2 - job types la,cal

H0:Jobs in Boise pay the same , on avg. as jobs in la 
H1:Jobs in Boise pay different incomes, on avg. from jobs in la 

Jobs 					Boise Los Angeles	Difference (LA-Boise)

Social worker (with bachelor's degree) 	36963       43542	6579


Mean = Total Difference / N(6) = 47486/6= 7914.13

SD= root of 1/N sigma N n-1 (xi-Meau) square = 438.38

T- Test = 7914.13-0/438.38\root of 6 = 18.04

Since, the test is 2 sided - P-value P(|T)>18.04= 2P(t>18.04)
df(degrees of freedom)= N-1=6-1=5
P-Value = 9.628
P-value is less then <0.05, so we reject the null hyptothesis.

There is difference between population mean of income of jobs in la then the income of jobs in Boise. 
Jobs in LA pay more then the jobs in Boise.

9.A manufacturing process produces ball bearings with diameters that have
a normal distribution with known standard deviation of .04 centimeters.
Ball bearings with diameters that are too small or too large are
undesirable. In order to test the claim that μ = 0.50 centimeters, perform a
two-tailed hypothesis test at the 5% level of significance. Assume that a
random sample of 25 gave a mean diameter of 0.51 centimeters.
Perform a hypothesis test (6 step procedure outlined in class) and state
your decision.

Sd=0.04
u=0.50
To do - Two-Tailed hypothesis 
N=25
Mean=0.51


Steps as stated in Class

1. State the H0(null),H1(alternate) Hypothesis = H0:U= 0.50,H1:U>0.51

2. Confidence Interval - 0.05 Alpha - 

3. Type of test - Z-Test

4. Determining the Critical Region - Z= +- 1.96

5. Collect - Find the Ttest value - mean – sample mean/std dev/root of n= 0.51-0.5/0.4/root of 25 = 1.25


6. Conclusion - Do not reject H0 as it lies within the range. 


10. A user of certain gauge of steel wire suspects that the SD of its breaking
strength in Newtons(N), is different from the value of .75 as specified by
the manufacturer
Consequently the user tests the breaking strength of each of a
random sample oh nine lenghths of wire and obtains the following
results.
72.1                74.5                72.8    75        73.4    75.4    76.1   
73.5    74.1
Assuming breaking strength to be normally distributed, test at the 10% level of significance, the manufacturer's specification. 

H0= null = Strength in N >0.75
H1- alternate - Strength is N<0.75
N=9
Mean= 72.1+74.5+72.8+75+73.4+75.4+76.1+73.5+74.1/9 = 666.9/9= 74.1 
SD= 0.75
Level of Significance - 10% So, Alpha is 0.1 = 1.397
Test value - mean – sample mean/std dev/root of n = 74.1-0/0.75/root of 9 = 74.1/0.75/3=
