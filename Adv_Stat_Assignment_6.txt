1.If a coin is tossed, find the probability distribution of getting tails.

Probability Distribution - a function of a discrete variable whose integral over any interval is the probability that the variate specified by it will lie within that interval.

f(x)= 1/n where n is the no of values the random variable may assume 

If a coin is tossed, either it is a head or a tail = 0 for head, 1 for tail 
P(0)=1/2
p(1)=1/2

6.Acme Corporation manufactures light bulbs. The CEO claims that an average Acme light
bulb lasts 300 days. A researcher randomly selects 15 bulbs for testing. The sampled
bulbs last an average of 290 days, with a standard deviation of 50 days. If the CEO's claim
were true, what is the probability that 15 randomly selected bulbs would have an average
life of no more than 290 days?

where x is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, s is the standard deviation of the sample, and n is the sample size.
t = [ x - μ ] / [ s / sqrt( n ) ] 
t= [290(Average)-300)/[50 /sqrt(15)
t=-10/12.90=-0.774
The degrees of freedom are equal to 15 - 1 = 14.
The t statistic is equal to - 0.7745966.
The calculator displays the cumulative probability: 0.226. 
Hence, if the true bulb life were 300 days, there is a 22.6% chance that the average bulb life for 15 randomly selected bulbs would be less than or equal to 290 days.

7.Suppose scores on an IQ test are normally distributed, with a population mean of 100.
Suppose 20 people are randomly selected and tested. The standard deviation in the
sample group is 15. What is the probability that the average test score in the sample
group will be at most 110?

The degrees of freedom are equal to 20 - 1 = 19.
The population mean equals 100.
The sample mean equals 110.
The standard deviation of the sample is 15.

We enter these values into the T Distribution Calculator. The calculator displays the cumulative probability: 0.996.
Hence, there is a 99.6% chance that the sample average will be no greater than 110.

8.Let’s say that 80% of all business startups in the IT industry report that they generate a
profit in their first year. If a sample of 10 new IT business startups is selected, find the
probability that exactly seven will generate a profit in their first year.First, do we satisfy
the conditions of the binomial distribution model?There are only two possible mutually
exclusive outcomes – to generate a profit in the first year or not (yes or no).There are a
fixed number of trails (startups) – 10.The IT startups are independent and it is reasonable
to assume that this is true.

do we satisfy the conditions of the binomial distribution model?

There are only two possible mutually exclusive outcomes – to generate a profit in the first year or not (yes or no).
There are a fixed number of trails (startups) – 10.
The IT startups are independent and it is reasonable to assume that this is true.
The probability of success for each startup is 0.8.
n = 10, p=0.80, q=0.20, x=7
P(X=7)=10! /7!(10-7)!(0.80) squared 7 (1-0.80) sqrt(10-7)
P(X=7)=0.2013  

10.Your basketball team is playing a series of 5 games against your opponent. The winner is
those who wins more games (out of 5).Let assume that your team is much more skilled
and has 75% chances of winning. It means there is a 25% chance of losing.What is the
probability of your team get 3 wins?

n = 5, p=0.75, q=0.25, x=3

P(X=3)=5!/3!(5-3)!0.75(3)(1-0.75)(5-3)=0.264

11.A box of candies has many different colors in it. There is a 15% chance of getting a pink
candy. What is the probability that exactly 4 candies in a box are pink out of 10?

n = 10, p=0.15, q=0.85, x=4
using binomial formula, P(x=4)=0.04


12.A continuous random variable say Y is following uniform distribution such that the
probability between 4 and 9 is ‘r’. Find the value of ‘r’.

In a uniform distribution, the probability is same for all possible values of given variable between the specified range, 
so if ‘p’ is the probability of any value between say a and b then p = 1(b−a) since the sum of all probabilities is always equal to 1. 

Here, p = r, a = 4 and b = 9.

So r =1(9−4) = 1/5.

13.In the old days, there was a probability of \displaystyle{0.8}0.8 of success in any attempt
to make a telephone call. (This often depended on the importance of the person making
the call, or the operator's curiosity!)Calculate the probability of having \displaystyle{7}7 successes in \displaystyle{10}10 attempts.

Prob. of success p =0.8 ,q =0.2
X=sucess in getting through 
Probabiity of 7 success in 10 attempts
P(X==7)=C10(7)(0.8)(0.7)*(0.2)(10-7)
=0.2013

14.A test is conducted which is consisting of 20 MCQs (multiple choices questions) with every
MCQ having its four options out of which only one is correct. Determine the probability
that a person undertaking that test has answered exactly 5 questions wrong.

 n = 20, n - k = 5, k = 20 - 5 = 15
the probability of success = probability of giving a right answer = s = 1/4
e probability of failure = probability of giving a wrong answer = 1 - s 
= 1 - 1/4 = 3/4
When we substitute these values in the formula for Binomial distribution we get,
P(exactly 5 out of 20 answers incorrect) = C (20, 5) * (1/4) 15 * (3/4)5
P (5 out of 20) = 0.0000034

15.A die marked A to E is rolled 50 times. Find the probability of getting a “D” exactly 5
times.

n = 50, k = 5, n - k = 45.

probability of success = probability of getting a “D”= s = 1/5
the probability of failure = probability of not getting a “D” = 1 - s = 4/5.


16.What is the probability that the marketing representative must select more than 6 people
before he ends one who attended the last home football game?

P(X>6)=1-P(X<=6)=1-[1-0.8(6)] =0.8[6] =0.262

17.How many people should we expect (that is, what is the average number) the marketing
representative needs to select before he nds one who attended the last home football
game? And, while we're at it, what is the variance?

The average numbers is -
Mean =E(X)=1/p= 1/0.20 = 5 

The Variance is 
standard deviation squared=Var(X)=(1-p)/p squared(2) =0.80/0.20(2) = 20

18.The number of miles that a particular car can run before its battery wears out is
exponentially distributed with an average of 10,000 miles. The owner of the car needs to
take a 5000-mile trip. What is the probability that he will be able to complete the trip
without having to replace the car battery?
X is the lifetime of the battery
t is the number of miles that the battery had been in use
prior to the start of the trip.
P(X > t + 5|X > t) = P(X > 5)
P(X>5000)=e -5000/10000 = e -(1/2) = 0.604
